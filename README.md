# Node.js Backend Documentation
## Introduction
* This Project follows Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 
### Here's a breakdown of how the folders align with the MVC pattern:
* **Controller folder**: This folder contains the controller files. It
handle the logic for processing requests, interacting with models, and preparing the data to be sent back to the client. 
* **Model folder**: This folder contain the model files. Models represent the data structures or entities of your application.  
* **Routes folder:**: This folder contain the model files. Models represent the data structures or entities of your application. The routes folder contains the route files, which define the endpoints and their associated controllers. Routes handle the incoming requests and direct them to the appropriate controller method based on the URL and HTTP method. They serve as the entry point for requests and establish the mapping between URLs and controller actions. 

# Installation and Setup
To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
`git clone <repository-url>`

2. **Install dependencies**
Navigate to the project root directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
`npm install`
This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3. **Configure environment variables** 
To configure environment variables when the `.env` file is located in the config folder, you can follow these steps:
* **Create the .env file**
Create a file named .env in the config folder of your project. create a folder named `config` and inside it create your `.env` file.
* **Define environment variables**
Inside the `.env` file, define the necessary environment variables. Here's an example:<br>
`DB_URI=<your-database-connection-string>`<br>
` JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret-key><br>
`
`PORT = 4000`<br>
`JWT_EXPIRE = 5d`<br>
`COOKIE_EXPIRES = 5`<br>
`COOKIE_EXPIRES = 5`<br>
`MONGO_URL = <your_db_url>`<br>
`SMPT_MAIL=vetmedman501@gmail.com`<br>
`SMPT_PASSWORD =<password>`<br>
`SMPT_HOST=smpt.gmail.com`<br>
`FRONTEND_URL = "http://localhost:3000"`<br>

4. **Start the backend server** 
To start the backend server in development mode with automatic restart on file changes, run the following command:
`npm run dev`

    -   If the connection is successful, the message "connected..." is logged to the console.
4.  Exporting the `connectDatabase` function to be used by other parts of the application.

# middleware
  - ### auth.js
1.  Importing required modules:

    -   `catchAsyncErrors`: A middleware function that wraps asynchronous route handlers and catches any errors that occur.
    -   `ErrorHandler`: A custom error handling utility.
    -   `jwt`: The JSON Web Token library for working with tokens.
    -   `User`: The User model representing the user collection in the database.
2.  Middleware function for user authentication (`isAuthenticatedUser`):

    -   This middleware function is responsible for authenticating the user based on the provided token.
    -   It expects the token to be stored in the `token` field of the request cookies.
    -   If no token is found, it returns an authentication error.
    -   If a token is found, it verifies the token using the `jwt.verify` method and the `process.env.JWT_SECRET` environment variable.
    -   If the token is valid, it retrieves the user information from the database based on the decoded token data and attaches it to the `req.user` object.
    -   Finally, it calls the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.
3.  Middleware function for role authorization (`authorizeRoles`):

    -   This middleware function takes a variable number of role parameters (`...roles`) that are allowed to access a specific resource.
    -   It returns another middleware function that will be used as a route handler.
    -   The returned middleware function checks if the user's role (`req.user.role`) is included in the provided roles.
    -   If the user's role is not included, it returns a forbidden error (`403`).
    -   If the user's role is allowed, it calls the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

  - ### catchAsyncError.js
This higher-order function is useful for handling asynchronous operations in route handlers and ensuring any errors are properly caught and forwarded to the error-handling middleware.
1.  The higher-order function takes `theFunc` as an argument.
2.  It returns another middleware function with the signature `(req, res, next)`.
3.  Inside the returned middleware function, `theFunc(req, res, next)` is called and executed.
4.  The return value of `theFunc` is wrapped in a `Promise.resolve()` call to ensure it resolves to a promise.
5.  The promise is then chained with `.catch(next)` to handle any errors that occur during the execution of `theFunc`.
6.  If an error occurs, the `next` function is called with the error as an argument, passing control to the next error-handling middleware.

- ### error.js
This error handling middleware allows you to handle specific types of errors and provide custom error messages and status codes in your Express application.
1.  The middleware function takes four parameters: `err`, `req`, `res`, and `next`.
2.  It checks if the `err` object has a `statusCode` property. If not, it sets it to `500` (Internal server error).
3.  It checks if the `err` object has a `message` property. If not, it sets it to `"Internal server error"`.
4.  The middleware then checks for specific types of errors and modifies the `err` object accordingly:
    -   If the error is a MongoDB CastError, it creates a new `ErrorHandler` with a custom message and a `400` status code.
    -   If the error is a Mongoose duplicate key error (code 11000), it creates a new `ErrorHandler` with a custom message and a `400` status code.
    -   If the error is a JsonWebTokenError, it creates a new `ErrorHandler` with a custom message and a `400` status code.
    -   If the error is a TokenExpiredError, it creates a new `ErrorHandler` with a custom message and a `400` status code.
5.  Finally, the middleware sends a JSON response with the appropriate status code and error message.

# utils 
 - ### errorhandler.js
-   The `ErrorHandler` class is defined, extending the `Error` class.
-   The constructor function is defined with two parameters: `message` and `statusCode`.
-   Inside the constructor, the `super()` method is called with the `message` parameter to set the error message.
-   The `statusCode` parameter is assigned to the `statusCode` property of the `ErrorHandler` instance.
-   The `Error.captureStackTrace()` method is called to capture the stack trace of the error.
-   Finally, the `ErrorHandler` class is exported to be used in other modules.

 - ### jwtToken.js
-   The `sendToken` function is defined with three parameters: `user`, `statusCode`, and `res` (the response object).
-   Inside the function, the `getJWTToken()` method is called on the `user` object to generate a JWT token.
-   Options for the cookie are defined, including the expiration date based on the value of `COOKIE_EXPIRES` from the environment variables.
-   The `res.cookie()` method is called to set the `token` cookie with the generated JWT token and the defined options.
-   Finally, a JSON response is sent back with the specified `statusCode`, along with the `user` object and the generated `token`.

 - ### sendEmail.js
 -   The `sendEmail` function is defined with a single parameter `options`, which is an object containing the email details such as `email`, `subject`, `message`, and `html` (optional).
-   Inside the function, a transporter is created using `nodemailer.createTransport()`. The transporter configuration includes the SMTP host, port, service, and authentication credentials (username and password) retrieved from environment variables.
-   The `mailOptions` object is created, which contains the email details such as the sender, recipient, subject, text body, and HTML body.
-   The `transporter.sendMail()` method is called with the `mailOptions` to send the email asynchronously.

# app.js
-   The Express application is created with `const app = express()`.
-   Middleware and dependencies are imported:
    -   `errorMiddleware` is imported from `'./middleware/error'`. This middleware handles error responses.
    -   `cookieParser` is imported from `'cookie-parser'`. It parses cookie headers and populates `req.cookies` with the parsed cookies.
    -   `dotenv` is imported to load environment variables from the "backend/config/config.env" file.
    -   `cors` is imported to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
-   Configuration is loaded with `dotenv.config({path:"backend/config/config.env"})`, which reads environment variables from the specified file.
-   Middleware is added to the application:
    -   `cors()` middleware is used to enable CORS.
    -   `cookieParser()` middleware is added to parse cookies.
    -   `express.json()` middleware is added to parse JSON request bodies.
-   Route files are imported:
    -   `userRoutes`, `animalTypeRoutes`, `treatmentTypeRoute`, `productsRoute`, `dailyEssentialRoutes`, `medicalCareRoute`, `orderRoutes`, and `varietyRoutes` are imported.
-   Routes are mounted to the application using `app.use()`:
    -   All routes from each route file are mounted under the "/api/v1" path.
-   A wildcard route is added to handle any unmatched routes. It responds with a 404 status and an error message.
-   The `errorMiddleware` is added as the last middleware to handle errors in the application.
-   The application is exported as `app`.

# servere.js
-   The dotenv.config() function is called to load environment variables from the "backend/config/config.env" file.
-   The `connectDatabase` function is called to establish a connection with the database.
-   The `process.on("uncaughtException", ...)` event handler is set up to handle uncaught exceptions. If an uncaught exception occurs, the error message is logged, and the server is shut down by calling `process.exit(1)`.
-   The `process.env.PORT` variable is used to determine the port on which the server will listen.
-   The server is started by calling `app.listen(port, ...)`, and a message is logged to indicate that the server is running.
-   The `process.on("unhandledRejection", ...)` event handler is set up to handle unhandled promise rejections. If an unhandled promise rejection occurs, the error message is logged, and the server is shut down by calling `server.close()` and then `process.exit(1)`.

# Important Notes for developers: 

  **there are some changes you have to do in code during development time to run it locally**
 - app.js (development)
```
app.use(cors({
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
    credentials: true,
    methods: ['GET','PUT','POST','OPTIONS'] 

}));
```
- app.js (production) -> as in azure portal cors is enabled and frontend url is added.
```
app.use(cors());
```
 - jwtToken.js (development) -> `httpOnly: true`
```
const sendToken = (user,statusCode, res) =>{
    const token = user.getJWTToken();

    //options for cookie
    const options = {
        expires: new Date(
            Date.now() + process.env.COOKIE_EXPIRES * 24 * 60 * 60 *1000
        ),
        httpOnly: true,
    };

    res.status(statusCode).cookie("token", token,options).json({
        success:true,
        user,
        token,
    })
}
```
 - jwtToken.js (production) -> comment httpOnly: true , and add 
    - ``` secure: true,
         sameSite: 'none'
       ```
```
  const sendToken = (user,statusCode, res) =>{
    const token = user.getJWTToken();
